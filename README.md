National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities
====

National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) codes are used by the IRS and others to classify nonprofit organizations in the United States. If you are working on a project that requires classification of nonprofit organizations, NTEE codes can be quite handy. You can learn more about NTEE codes at the [Urban Institute website][urban].

While NTEE codes are freely public, I didn't find the codes in friendly formats. This project provides NTEE codes as both a CSV and JSON file. The CSV file has two columns (code and description), while the JSON file is a dictionary where the key is the NTEE code and the value is the code's description.

I pulled the NTEE codes from the [National Center for Charitable Statistics NTEE search page][search].
